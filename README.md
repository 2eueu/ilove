#  I ❤️ Jeongseon – Tribute Web Page

A humorous, heartfelt surprise page created for a friend, Jeongseon.  
This web project combines anime aesthetics, custom imagery, and a real-time flight automation tool — all bundled as a gift for her hard work at Incheon Airport.

##  What is This?

Jeongseon used to manually count the number of flights departing from Incheon Airport’s Terminal 2.  
This page was made to **automate her daily task**, celebrate our friendship, and have some fun with design.

>  “Why count flights by hand when Python and love can do it for you?”
